# Here is an example configuration file for your staging environment.

# First, we define the values for an example sensu_client template. In this example, we changed to including a "virtual"
# subscription instead of "physical", which was set in the production environment.
sensu_client.erb:
  target: /etc/sensu/conf.d/client.json
  config:
    sensu_host: 'sensu.example.com'
    sensu_subscriptions:
      - common
      - virtual
      - mongo

# This is a dummy template provided by the DummyTemplateSource. You'll notice that because we're not pulling in
# DummyDataSource, the dummy_global variable is not set, but the template is still built without an error (the
# value is just left blank). Here we also write the file to a different location that the one in the production
# environment.
dummy.erb:
  target: /tmp/files/dummy-staging.txt
  owner: root
  group: wheel
  perms: 0644
  config:
    dummy: 'Text from a filesource - staging environment'
