# Here is an example configuration file for your production environment.

# We override a setting from common.yaml for this environment.
common:

# First, we define the values for an example sensu_client template :
sensu_client.erb:
  target: /etc/sensu/conf.d/client.json
  config:
    sensu_host: 'sensu.example.com'
    sensu_subscriptions:
      - common
      - physical
      - mongo

# This is a dummy template provided by the DummyTemplateSource. You'll notice that because we're not pulling in
# DummyDataSource, the dummy_global variable is not set, but the template is still built without an error (the
# value is just left blank).
dummy.erb:
  target: /tmp/files/dummy.txt
  owner: root
  group: wheel
  perms: 0644
  config:
    dummy: 'Text from a filesource - production environment'
